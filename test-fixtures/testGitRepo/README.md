# This is the master branch

How to update this?

You will want to "re-initialize this folder" by createing your .git repo

```shell
mv gitDir .git
```

From here, you can CD into the folder and run git commands. Anything you do will be recorded into the .git

Before you commit those git history changes, please create the gitDir again from the new .git

```shell
mv .git gitDir
```
